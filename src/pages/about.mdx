## What I do

I’m a self-taught programmer, that set a goal to become a frontend developer.
I started this journey in 2017 while I am the father of my three children and
working full time in a non-programming job. I have built several react web
apps for small business, looking at a design I can convert it into an HTML CSS
template with pixel-perfect precision. I always use GIT to track my progress
and files, as well as to collaborate with other developers.

Currently, I keep learning and building things in Javascript and React
technologies. I’m looking for a position where I can progress and challenge my
skills. I live in Beer Yaakov, Israel.
